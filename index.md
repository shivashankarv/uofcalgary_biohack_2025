### 🚀 **My (Highly Nonlinear) Journey**

| Role                        | What I did 📌                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parabilis Medicines** _(Now)_  | AI-drive design of peptide binders with ML.                       |
| **Orna Therapeutics**       | AI-assisted circular RNA design; NGS-based screening.                   |
| **Montai Therapeutics**     | In silico modeling compound-target/pathway interactions and combinatorial effects.    |
| **Novartis (NIBR)**         | Computational RNA biology, Network biology, built the MoA Central knowledge graph.             |

💡 “If the science excites you, the cause is noble, and you believe you can add value—**dive head-first!**”

---

### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First Bioinformatics Product:** MoA Central (Novartis)
Built a knowledge graph search engine using **PageRank** to triage compound-target relationships.
<br> 💡 _"Frames target prioritization as a search problem—and algorithms can truly power discovery."_

---

### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First Employee at a Startup:** Montai Health
First full-time hire—helped shape an AI-driven drug discovery platform.
<br> 😂 _"Ironically, naming the company was our toughest challenge—we tried ranked-choice voting, but the CEO ultimately made an executive call."_

---


### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First AI-driven Screen:** Orna Therapeutics
Created an AI-powered circular RNA screening platform combining RNA-Language Models, structural RNA design, and large-scale NGS screening.
<br> 🍕 _"We ended up ordering a suspicious amount of food, always justified by ‘brainstorming’ sessions!"_

### ⚔️ **Challenges & Lessons Learned**

| Challenge 🚧                                  | Lesson Learned 📚                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transitioning from Bioinformatics → ML**    | 💡 **ML transforms your thinking:** Predictive models shifted how I fundamentally approach scientific problems.  |
| **Convincing teams to trust ML**              | 💬 **Communication is critical:** Frame everything in biological terms, and show clear, incremental value. |
| **Biology + ML > ML alone**                   | 🔥 **Insights + models:** Pairing ML-generated sequences + RNA structural insights = best RNA designs at Orna. |
| **Adopting software engineering early**       | 🛠️ **Build lasting tools:** Let your legacy live on after you!           |
| **Ensuring wet-lab accessibility**            | 🧪 **Real impact = usability:** Making models and tools accessible to experimentalists to effect science.    |

### 🎯 **(Unsolicited)Advice to BioHackers**

Here’s what I'd tell my younger self—and any aspiring BioHacker today:

1. **Chase Problems, Not Techniques**  
   🔬 Your favorite dataset will teach you the most.
2. **Speak Biology First, ML Second**  
   🧬 Learn how biologists think and communicate. Effective collaboration accelerates your impact.
3. **Get Comfortable with Uncertainty**  
   🌊 The most rewarding science happens at the intersection of uncertainty and exploration.
4. **Adopt Software Best Practices Early**  
   🛠️ Clean code, good documentation, and thoughtful engineering amplify your impact and longevity.
