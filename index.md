### 🤖 **I Asked ChatGPT to Interview Me**

To prep for this talk, I asked ChatGPT to interview me!

Here are some key questions that guided this presentation:
1. **Career Journey 🌱**
2. **Scientific Breakthroughs & "Firsts" 🥇**  _What experiences significantly shaped your career trajectory?_
3. **Tackling Real-World Challenges 🚧**  _What major roadblocks taught you the most valuable lessons?_
4. **Practical Advice for Future BioHackers 🎯**

### 🚀 **My (Highly Nonlinear) Journey**

1. **Novartis (NIBR)** - Computational RNA biology, Network biology, built the MoA Central knowledge graph.
2. **Montai Therapeutics** - In silico modeling compound-target/pathway interactions and combinatorial effects.
3. **Orna Therapeutics** - AI-assisted circular RNA design; NGS-based screening. 
4. **Parabilis Medicines** _(Now)_ - AI-drive design of peptide binders with ML. 

💡 “If the science excites you, the cause is noble, and you believe you can add value—**dive head-first!**”

---

### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First Bioinformatics Product:** MoA Central (Novartis)
Built a knowledge graph search engine using **PageRank** to triage compound-target relationships.
<br> 💡 _"Frames target prioritization as a search problem—and algorithms can truly power discovery."_

---

### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First Employee at a Startup:** Montai Health
First full-time hire—helped shape an AI-driven drug discovery platform.
<br> 😂 _"Ironically, naming the company was our toughest challenge—we tried ranked-choice voting, but the CEO ultimately made an executive call."_

---


### 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

##### **First AI-driven Screen:** Orna Therapeutics
Created an AI-powered circular RNA screening platform combining RNA-Language Models, structural RNA design, and large-scale NGS screening.
<br> 🍕 _"We ended up ordering a suspicious amount of food, always justified by ‘brainstorming’ sessions!"_

### 🎯 **(Unsolicited)Advice to BioHackers**

Here’s what I'd tell my younger self—and any aspiring BioHacker today:

1. **Chase Problems, Not Techniques**  
   🔬 Your favorite dataset will teach you the most.
2. **Speak Biology First, ML Second**  
   🧬 Learn how biologists think and communicate. Effective collaboration accelerates your impact.
3. **Get Comfortable with Uncertainty**  
   🌊 The most rewarding science happens at the intersection of uncertainty and exploration.
4. **Adopt Software Best Practices Early**  
   🛠️ Clean code, good documentation, and thoughtful engineering amplify your impact and longevity.
