# 🌟 **Breakthroughs (Many Firsts!)**

| "Firsts" 🥇                           | Highlights & Learnings 📖                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **First Bioinformatics Product:** MoA Central (Novartis) | Built a knowledge graph search engine using **PageRank** to triage compound-target relationships.<br> :bulb: _"We discovered that target prioritization was essentially a search problem—and algorithms can truly power discovery."_ |
| **First Employee at a Startup:** Montai Health           | First full-time hire—helped shape an AI-driven drug discovery platform.<br> 😂 _"Ironically, naming the company was our toughest challenge—we tried ranked-choice voting, but the CEO ultimately made an executive call."_          |
| **First AI-driven Screening Platform:** Orna Therapeutics | Created an AI-powered circular RNA screening platform combining RNA-Language Models, structural RNA design, and large-scale NGS screening.<br> 🍕 _"We ended up ordering a suspicious amount of food, always justified by ‘brainstorming’ sessions!"_          |

:bulb: **Key Insight:**  
_"Innovation often starts from surprisingly simple (and funny!) human moments."_

# ⚔️ **Challenges & Lessons Learned**

| Challenge 🚧                                  | Lesson Learned 📚                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transitioning from Bioinformatics → ML**    | :bulb: **ML transforms your thinking:** Predictive models shifted how I fundamentally approach scientific problems.                                      |
| **Convincing teams to trust ML**              | :speech_balloon: **Communication is critical:** Frame everything in biological terms, and show clear, incremental value.                                   |
| **Biology + ML > ML alone**                   | :dna: **Insights + models = 🔥:** Pairing ML-generated sequences with RNA structural insights delivered our best RNA designs at Orna.                     |
| **Adopting software engineering early**       | 🛠️ **Build lasting tools:** MoA Central at Novartis isn't around anymore because we neglected best practices early—don’t make the same mistake!           |
| **Ensuring wet-lab accessibility**            | 🧪 **Real impact = usability:** Making models and tools accessible to experimentalists is the true test of your computational work.                        |

:mag_right: **Core Insight:**  
_"Your greatest impact happens when computational and experimental teams speak the same language."_

# 🎯 **Advice to BioHackers**

Here’s what I'd tell my younger self—and any aspiring BioHacker today:

1. **Chase Problems, Not Techniques**  
   :microscope: Follow biological questions you're deeply curious about. Your favorite dataset will teach you the most.

2. **Speak Biology First, ML Second**  
   🧬 Learn how biologists think and communicate. Effective collaboration accelerates your impact.

3. **Get Comfortable with Uncertainty**  
   🌊 The most rewarding science happens at the intersection of uncertainty and exploration.

4. **Adopt Software Best Practices Early**  
   🛠️ Clean code, good documentation, and thoughtful engineering amplify your impact and longevity.
